* If the numbers of hearts is 0 (zero), everything (inclusive the save) is permanently lost.
* It's possible destroy one heart to teleport the last saved position.
* The dark spells spent the maximum percentage of vitality. The more strong
  dark spells, those spent hearts.
* It is possibly to invade the worlds of other players, but is not possibly
  interact with the items that world.
* It is possibly invoke a friend to your world, but he cannot interact with
  items from that world.
* Places react to the player bonds.
* NPCs react to player bonds.
* Creatures react to player bonds.
* The most of the world dimensions are dynamically generated (infinity world).
* The infinity world can be played offline and is single player.
* When the dimension is generated, the portals are created. That portals can
  be used to access a new dimension.
* Each dimension are finite, but very bigger.
* There are portals that can used to access online dimensions. That dimensions
  are fixed and is multiplayer.
* The first dimension is fixed and there is a portal to access the main online
  dimension.
* The items, creatures and dimensions are dynamically generated.
* There are fixed and dynamic NPCs with different rarity and their locations
  and roles are shuffled.
* There are coliseums where hearts are lost to death, but the winner gains
  the loser's items.
* There are divine items (extremely strong and rare) that need sacrifices (except
  if the character has the "Friend of the Gods" bond) to be able to have.
  Furthermore, it is necessarily to have the needed attributes to be ably to equipe
  (not necessarily can be use). Maybe it is possibly to equipe a divine items
  without the necessary attribute, but the debuffs are very high.
* The quantity of divine items is very limited.
* If the player try to take a divine item, but he is not strong enough to make the
  sacrifice, the item will to vanish and will back to game (probably in other location).
* The divine items will the power equated to a rare item if the owner does not
  activate the item.
* If the player try to activate a divine item without the necessary power,
  the player will lose his all hearts, except 1 (one), and the divine item
  will to vanish and will back to game (probably in a different location than
  the original).
* The activation process increase the item level, requires a needed attributes
  and involves a sacrifice. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the level
  released. Each level requires an increasing sacrifice.
* The activation of the divine item is only valid for the player that did the
  activation; For the other players the divine item is only activated if they
  activated.
* A divine weapon on level 7 is more powerful than all other non-divine weapon.
* The Maximum level a divine item can reach is 10, but is necessary attributes
  equated to one god to activate in that level.
* The gods have the maximum power limit attainable in the game.
* There are items that support divine items (show needed attributes; serve as
  partial sacrifice; show players that have a divine item equipped; show
  players that are the bonds "Friend of the gods", etc.).
* There are no safe areas on war servers. Dying spends hearts in
  percentage (10%).
* Anyone with the "Friend of the gods" bond can steal a divinely equipped item,
  even in safe zones, unless the owner has the "Friend of the gods" bond,
  "Worthy of the gods" or has more power than the thief (power criteria
  varies from item to item).
* Each god has a bond similar in effect to the bond "friend of the gods" but
  is only valid for the items associated with him. The same thing happens with
  the "Worthy of the gods" bond.
* Facing a god with the divine item associated with him is stupid. The god will
  just get the item from you.
* If all divine items associated with a god are found, the amount of items in
  the game will be restored.
* The less limited quantity items there are in the game, the harder it will be
  for it to appear.
* The triumphal entry can be used for whoever has an item equipped above the 
  legendary. If done in an online dimension, all players in that dimension receive 
  notification that someone has made a triumphant entry, showing what the item
  was. The notified player can be teleported to the place.
  (That can be used to attract enemy players and start a war).
* On the online servers, players carn team up to stat a war.
* Wars can only take place in specific places in the dimension.
* In peaceful places there may be bars with televisions where you can 
  watch, in real time, live wars or championships with other players.
* World championships take place outside the dimensions, where players compete 
  against each other in a year-long standings to find out who is the champion.
* The dimensions are the only places players can increase their power.
* The legendary and divine items cannot be used on championships.
* When interacting with another NPC, there are different options to choose from
  (depending on what the NPCs role is). Every action choice usually has
  irreversible consequences.
* Each decision made increases or decreases certain personality points.
* Personality points are used to define how useful (or useless) an NPC will be
  to the player, as well as to increase or decrease the probability of events 
  happening or items appearing.
* Each god has affinities with different personality points.
* The more affinity the player's personality points are with a particular god,
  the more chances the player will have to be helped or chosen by that god.
* The gods fear each other. This prevents them from acting more firmly on their
  goals. Because of this, they need to use humans as a means to achieve their
  goals.
* The god's goals can be fulfilled by their chosen ones in the infinite world
  (dynamically generated offline dimensions). These goals are achieved through
  very difficult missions, but with many rewards.
* Being chosen by a god is stupidly difficult.

## Way of Evolution of the Character:
Each attribute has two values, the points and the absorb value. Points are
numerical representations of the efficiency of a given movement. Absorb values
define the percentage of points to be absorbed when defeating a particular
creature or NPC (absorbing its DNA). The percentage of points to be absorbed
by a given attribute will be defined by the attribute's absorption value
divided by the sum of all the absorption values of all attributes, multiplied
by a formula to be defined. When absorbing DNA from a creature or NPC, the
player will have their absorb values incremented by the enemy's absorb values for
each attribute.

Each character, creature or NPC has points that reflect their bodily
characteristics. When absorbing DNA from a creature or NPC, the points for
those traits are absorbed. When an amount of body points for a given trait is
reached, the player can (if desired) change its appearance, adding physical
traits from creatures and NPCs that have had their DNA absorbed.
